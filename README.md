# Portfolio Website for Coursework 1 for the Fundamentals of Web Technology module (4BUIS011C-n)

This repository was created to fulfill the requirements for the Coursework 1 of Fundamentals of Web Technology module. The repository is hosted on [this link](https://bextuychiev.github.io/00011829_4BUIS011C-n/index.html) using GitHub pages.

From the list of options to submit the coursework, a portfolio website was chosen. The simple website includes 6 pages with links to an articles page (main), contact me, skills, pricing, about me and info pages. 

The `files` folder contains all extra files (other than code files) used in the project. The `html` folder contains all the other pages of the website excluding the main page, `index.html`. A single CSS file, `home.css` was used for all pages, which can be found inside the `styles` folder.
